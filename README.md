Project title: [Whac-A-Mole]
Project page: [https://github.com/merlin181/CodeBenders]
Instructions for use (allowable actions): [To play the game, download all file for the whac-A-Mole folder, compile all classes and run the AppHitGame class to start the game. The interface will appear with four buttons, play, instructions, characters and exit. “play button” takes you straight to the game whereby to hit the mole you will have to use a mouse or touchpad to hit the moles by clicking directly on them, sometimes a double click is required. The game plays for 60 seconds. The mole hit gives player points, the bomb icon, when hit results in game over, the clock icon which appears every 20 seconds, gives player 10 extra seconds each time when hit. “Instructions button” shows a text-area that gives player instructions on playing the game. “characters button” gives a player character options for the game. “exit button” exits the game and disposes the frame.]

Assumptions: [We assume the system will run as expected, however there may be issues with overlapping of sound, character glitches and lack of efficient response from mouse event.]
Limitations: [The game does not have a multiplayer, there are no coins to be collected to unlock characters, there is also a lack of multiple levels of the game.]
